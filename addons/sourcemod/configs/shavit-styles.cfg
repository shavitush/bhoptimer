		"bunnyhopping"		"1" // Per-style sv_enablebunnyhopping. Leave as 1 if you want bunnyhopping to maintain player speed. This setting will override _strafe map settings.

		// Convar overrides

		"startinair"        "0" // 0 = Start-zones will only start the timer if the player is on the ground. 1 = timer will start without requiring the player to be on the ground in the start zone. This means with 1 that it will basically only start the timer counter once you've left the start-zone. This should only be used on gamemodes that are intended for this kind of mechanic (i.e. not bhop). Also it might be easily abusable. GL. Also this probably won't work unless you set either `"prespeed" "1"` or `"nozaxisspeed" "0"`.

		"force_hsw"			"0" // Force half-sideways gameplay. 1 for regular HSW and 2 for surf-HSW.
		"force_groundkeys"	"0" // Forces the above settings even while on ground. e.g. enabling this will not allow W/D or W/A prestrafing when playing styles that disable the keys.

		"block_pright"		"0" // Block +right. 2 to stop timer.
		"block_pstrafe"		"0" // Prevent button inconsistencies (including +pstrafe). May have false positives when players lag. Will prevent some strafe hacks too. Set this to 2 to also stop the timer.

		// KZ settings
		"kzcheckpoints"		"0" // KZ styled checkpoints. They reset upon timer start and you don't get reverted to a save state, and you cannot save when airborne or someone else's checkpoints.
		"kzcheckpoints_ladders" "0" // KZ styled checkpoints allowed to checkpoint onto ladders (like GOKZ)
		"kzcheckpoints_ontele"	"-1" // The style to be changed to on client teleporting to a checkpoint in KZ styles. The destination style will be inaccessible if enabled. -1 or set "kzcheckpoints" to 0 for disabled.

		"autostrafe"        "0" // 0 = Disabled. 1 = 1tick autostrafer. 2 = velocity/autogain. 3 = velocity/autogain (no speed loss). 4 = a basic +moveleft/+moveright presser when turning. -1 = Lets players toggle between 1tick and velocity/autogain.
		"autoprestrafe"     "0" // 0 = Disabled. 1 = Enables TAS prestrafer on the ground to reach.
