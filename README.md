# shavit's bhop timer

This is nearly an all-in-one server plugin suite for Counter-Strike: Source, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and Team Fortress 2 that adds a timer system and many other utilities, so you can install it and run a proper bunnyhop server.

Includes a records system, map zones (start/end marks etc), bonuses, HUD with useful information, chat processor, miscellaneous things such as weapon commands/spawn point generator, bots that replay the best records of the map, sounds, statistics, segmented running, a fair & competitive rankings system, and more!

# Requirements:
* Steam version of Counter-Strike: Source, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, or Team Fortress 2.
* [Metamod:Source](https://www.sourcemm.net/downloads.php?branch=stable) and [SourceMod](https://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php?branch=stable) 1.12 or higher.
* A MySQL database (preferably locally hosted) if your database is likely to grow big, or if you want to use the rankings plugin. MySQL server version of 5.5.5 or above (MariaDB equivalent works too) is required.

# Optional requirements, for the best experience:
* [eventqueuefix](https://github.com/hermansimensen/eventqueue-fix)
  * Allows for timescaling boosters and is used to fix some exploits. (Use this instead of `boosterfix`)
  * (included in bhoptimer release zips)
  * Along with using [eventqueuefixfix](https://github.com/srcwr/eventqueuefixfix) at the same time to fix eventqueuefix on Windows after the 2025-02-18 update.
* [SteamWorks](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=229556)
  * Used to grab `{serverip}` in advertisements.
* [DynamicChannels](https://github.com/Vauff/DynamicChannels)

# Installation

* [Build from source](https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/wiki/1.-Installation-(from-source))
* [Download an existing release](https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/releases) - installing is simply drag & drop into the  game server's directory.

# Configuration

The [wiki](https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/wiki) contains most relevant information regarding configuration, under the 2nd category's pages.

Configuration files are in `cfg/sourcemod/plugin.shavit-*.cfg` and `addons/sourcemod/configs/shavit-*`.

# bhoptimer modules:

### shavit-core (REQUIRED)

It handles connections to the database and exposes an API (natives/forwards) for developers and other modules.
Calculations, gameplay mechanics and such are all handled by the core plugin.

Includes *but not limited to*: Custom chat messages and colors, snapshots, pausing/resuming, styles (configurable), automatic bunnyhopping, strafe/sync meters that work for most playstyles, double-step fixer (+ds), practice mode, +strafe blocking, +left/right blocking, pre-jump blocking, HSW style (including SHSW) that cannot be abused with joypads, per-style `sv_airaccelerate` values, teleportation commands (start/end).

Zones are trigger based and are very lightweight.

The zones plugin includes some less common features such as: Multiple tracks (main/bonus), zone editing (after setup), snapping zones to walls/corners/grid, zone setup using the cursor's position, configurable sprite/colors for zone types, zone tracks (main/bonus - can be extended), manual adjustments of coordinates before confirmations, teleport zones, glitch zones, no-limit zones (for styles like 400-velocity), flat/3D boxes for zone rendering, an API and more.

Player commands:
!replay - Opens the replay bot menu.

Admin commands: (RCON flag)
!deletereplay - Open replay deletion menu.

### shavit-replay-recorder
